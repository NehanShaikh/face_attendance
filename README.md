# 🎓 AI-Powered Smart Attendance System Using Face Recognition

An intelligent **face recognition–based attendance system** developed using **AI, Computer Vision, and Web Technologies**.  
This project automates attendance marking using real-time face detection and recognition, storing data securely in a **PostgreSQL** database.

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- MTCNN (for Face Detection)  
- FaceNet (for Face Embedding & Recognition)

### 🖥️ Backend
- Node.js (Express.js)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for Authentication
- Nodemailer (for Email Notifications)
- Hosted on **Render**

### 💻 Frontend

## 🗄️ Database Schema (PostgreSQL)

| Table | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **users** | Stores login credentials (admin, faculty, student) |
| **students** | Contains student details |
| **faculty** | Faculty details and subject allocations |
| **subjects** | Master table for all subjects |
| **attendance** | Stores attendance records with timestamps |
| **face_embeddings** | Stores face embeddings generated by FaceNet |
| **faculty_students** | Links faculty and assigned students |
| **student_timetable** | Maps students to their class schedule |

## 👥 User Roles & Features

### 👑 **Admin Dashboard**
- Creates login credentials for **students** and **faculty**
- Manages student, faculty, subject, and timetable data
- Assigns students and subjects to faculty

### 🧑‍🏫 **Faculty Dashboard**
- Views assigned students
- Runs **Face Recognition** to mark attendance
- Can manually update or verify attendance
- Sends registration emails to students

### 🧑‍🎓 **Student Dashboard**
- Logs in using credentials created by Admin
- Completes self-registration (name, roll, class, email, etc.)
- Views attendance records and timetable

---

## 🧩 System Workflow (Methodology)

1. **Admin** creates user credentials for faculty and students.  
2. **Students** log in using provided credentials and self-register.  
3. **Faculty** log in to view assigned students and subjects.  
4. During class, faculty click the **"Run Face Recognition"** button on their dashboard.  
5. The system detects faces via a camera/CCTV feed using **MTCNN**.  
6. Extracted embeddings are compared with stored embeddings using **FaceNet**.  
7. Matched faces are marked as **Present** in the **attendance** table.  
8. Attendance details are instantly reflected in the **student dashboard**.
